The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, it can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if not used correctly. For example, using spaces inconsistently within the `calc()` function can result in errors.  Another common issue involves the use of units within the calculation.  Mixing units without proper conversion can cause unexpected results.  Finally, nesting `calc()` functions too deeply or in complex ways can lead to browser inconsistencies and unexpected outcomes.
